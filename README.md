I've pulled this project over to attempt to get it, at minimum, running successfully on newer versions of PHP.
I'm undecided on fixing the many, many glaring security holes.

If you're interested in helping, please send me a message. I'm a college student with a family, so time will be limited.

Many years ago, when I was young and dumb, I wrote a simple little game based on the game *Dragon Warrior* for the NES. It was fun, it helped me learn how to code, and a lot of people liked it.
I am now turning it over to the open source community. Fork it, do what you want, make it your own.
Couple things to keep in mind though:
- It's super old. It may not even work on modern versions of PHP. It may have security issues. I have no idea.
- I have moved on with my life, and am no longer changing or doing anything with this game.
- I am not providing help or support. You're on your own.
- I am not accepting pull requests. If you fork this, you are welcome to do whatever you want, but no changes will be merged back into this.
- Quite frankly, I don't really suggest that you use this as is. It's probably better as an inspiration for your own project. 
- Have fun with this. I gave it a lot of love a long time ago. I hope it inspires you to give something a lot of love as well.
- This Git repo represents the final released version, 1.1.11, originally released 3/26/2006.
